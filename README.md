# JavaScript Project

## Introduction

> This project utilizes HTML, CSS & JS. The project involved creating a portfolio with dynamic animations. While this ultimately wasn't my final portfolio, the project is a good demonstration of my abilities to code.

## Installation

I recommend downloading the entire repository & running the index file.
